Interpreting user needs and translating them into a program is a critical skill for any developer, as it involves understanding the user's underlying goals and challenges, not just their explicit requests. This process often begins by gathering requirements through interviews and surveys, which are then distilled into functional and non-functional requirements for the program. A powerful technique that helps with this is creating user stories, which are simple descriptions of a feature from the user's perspective. This approach helps a development team focus on the user's perspective and the value a feature provides, rather than just a list of technical requirements. By framing features as stories, the team can better understand the context and motivation behind each request, leading to more thoughtful design and a program that truly solves the user's problems.

When it comes to developing programs, I believe in a structured, iterative approach that ensures the final product is high-quality and scalable. This cyclical process of planning, coding, testing, and deployment allows for continuous feedback and improvement throughout the project's lifecycle. In my future work, I plan to continue using my experience in Agile, particularly Scrum, to accomplish my goals. This framework emphasizes short development cycles, daily team meetings, and continuous user feedback. I believe this promotes flexibility, transparency, and a focus on delivering value quickly, which is essential for building great software.

Being a good team member in software development extends beyond just writing good code. It means being a proactive communicator, sharing progress, and raising concerns early and often. A great team member is also accountable for their work and owns their mistakes, while also being willing to help others. They are empathetic and open to constructive feedback, understanding that a program's success is a collective effort. Ultimately, a good team member is a reliable and collaborative partner who contributes to a positive team culture and is invested in the success of the entire project.
